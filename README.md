# Executive Summary
## What is this project for?
https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment - Using this dataset, we are taking tweets people have made about various airlines, and splitting them into aspects (or the topics) and deriving the sentiment of the tweet
## Why are we doing this?
If companies can pull aspects and sentiment from tweets, they will have a constantly growing source of social listening that can clue them in on what they are doing well, and potentially big issues that can be jumped on quickly (announcing a delay or bringing the website back up)
## What do we recommend based on this project?
Sentiment Analysis is a powerful tool that can bring great insight towards seemingly small things like tweets, where little value towards companies seems to be found (90% of tweets are mostly noise). Aspect identifying is a challenging process that requires a lot of manual labor and will need more research done to make effective for the workplace.
